## üìù Project Description

**AyudPet** is a comprehensive solution that includes a web platform and a mobile application, developed for the `Integration Workshop II & IV` course at the `Universidad Cat√≥lica de Temuco`.

The project aims to optimize the pet adoption process by efficiently connecting foundations and rescuers with potential adopters. Through our platforms, we offer centralized tools for managing animals, standardizing information, and improving visibility to increase the rate of responsible and successful adoptions.
